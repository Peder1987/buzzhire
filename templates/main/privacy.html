        <p>
        The
        Buzzhire website may use "cookies" to help you personalize
        your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on

        <p>
        One
        of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
        feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
        server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
        personalize Buzzhire pages, or register with Buzzhire site or
        services, a cookie helps Buzzhire to recall your specific information
        on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
        personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
        and so on. When you return to the same Buzzhire website, the
        information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
        easily use the Buzzhire features that you customized.</p>

        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the Buzzhire services or websites you visit.</p>
